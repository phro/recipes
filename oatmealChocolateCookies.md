# Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies #
This is the recipe to the delicious chocolate chip cookies from an old newspaper taped to a cue-card that's been lying around for years. Over the years, its been modified in various ways. They are so fun to eat.

*Yield*         One to two batches (about 60 per batch, unless your cookies are massive), evidently you're not supposed to triple the recipe. If it does come to that. However, I'd just say make one double batch and a single batch, then alter the recipe slightly (add M&M's, pecans, Toblerone, etc.).
*Prep time*     I have no idea; I usually take forever when it comes to stuff like this. If you're quick, say 15min. That's a guess, though.
*Cook time*     9 to 11 minutes, although I have accidentally left them in the oven for 20 minutes or so, and still they turned out pretty good (especially if you're the kind of person who likes toast on the very-brown side)
*Total time*    Anything from an hour to four, depending on how ridiculously slow you go, and how many times you've done it before. Understandably, it will take longer if you make a double batch (something which I highly recommend, since they taste so darn good!) With a double batch, I have been able to do it in an hour (albeit by pawning off the cleaning to someone else).

|  2 cups      |  4 cups     | chocolate chips (or M&M's, chopped Toblerone, etc.)     |
|              |             |                      |
|              |             |     *Optional*       |
|  1 cup       |  2 cups     | nuts (pecans are yummy)               |

## Directions ##
0.  Pre-heat the oven to 375ºF (190ºC). [Place the butter near the oven to soften it.]

1.  Combine *flour*, *soda* and *salt* in a bowl (if you're doing a double recipe, the bowl will need to be sizable).

2.  Beat *butter*, *sugar* and *vanilla* in a large mixer bowl. Add *eggs* one at a time, beating well after each addition.

3.  Gradually beat in the flower mixture from (1). Stir in the *chocolate chips* and (if you want) the *nuts* and *coconut*.

4.  Use a rounded tablespoon or roll them in your palms to make little balls (squash ball-sized). For less clean-up later, use parchment paper or rubber cookie mats.

5.  Chill the dough for 0min, 30min, 1h, or 24h. I haven't actually tested the positive times (but have heard they may make the cookies less crispy and rounder).

6.  Bake the cookies for 9-11 minutes or until they are golden brown. Let them stand for a couple minutes, then let them cool on wire racks, although, giving them a bit more time to cool before transferring them to the racks will help prevent them from 'melting' through the racks.

7.  Avoid dramatically throwing them all over the floor, as it makes them less appetizing. However, since I only one data point on this claim, you never really know... ;)
