Softbatch Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip Cookies
=============================================
Replacing some of the butter from my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe with cream cheese created cookies that are soft, thick, moist, and tender. Although you can't taste the cream cheese, the cookies have a richness and depth of flavor like no other cookies I've tried. Plus there's an abundance of chocolate in every bite. The dough can be made in advance, refrigerated, and baked as desired, up to 5 days later. A great option to have for fresh, warm cookies without having to mix up dough. I highly recommend these cookies!

*YIELD*: about 28 medium-small cookies
*PREP TIME*: 10 minutes
*COOK TIME*: 8 minutes
*TOTAL TIME*: 3+ hours, for dough chilling

Ingredients:
------------
Single          Double
1/2 cup         1 cup           (1,2 stick(s)) unsalted butter, softened
1/4 cup         1/2 cup         cream cheese, softened (use cream cheese in a block or spreadable, don't use fat-free, light or whipped)
3/4 cup         1 1/2 cup       light brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup         1/2 cup         granulated sugar
1               2               large egg(s)
2               4               teaspoons vanilla extract

2 1/4 cups      4 1/2 cups      all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons     4 teaspoons     cornstarch
1 teaspoons     2 teaspoons     baking soda
1/4 teaspoon    1/2 teaspoon    salt, optional and to taste
2 1/4 cups      4 1/2 cups      semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks (I used 1 cup chips and 1 1/4 cups chunks)

Directions:
-----------
1.  To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the *butter*, *cream cheese* (measure it by smooshing it into a 1/4-cup measure), *sugars*, *egg*, *vanilla*, and beat on medium-high speed until well-creamed, light and fluffy, about 5 minutes (or use an electric hand mixer and beat for at least 7 minutes).

2.  Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the *flour*, *cornstarch*, *baking soda*, optional *salt*, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute.

3.  Add chocolate chips and chunks, and beat momentarily to incorporate, or fold in by hand.

4.  Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping mounds (I made 28). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly with your palm, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter.

5.  Preheat oven to *350F*, line a baking sheet with a non-stick baking mat or spray with cooking spray and place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet). Bake for *8 to 9 minutes*, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if slightly undercooked, pale and glossy in the center. Do not bake longer than 10 minutes as cookies will firm up as they cool (The cookies shown in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled overnight, allowed to come to room temp for 15 minutes, and were baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated at the 4-minute mark. They have chewy edges with soft, pillowy centers). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling.

6.  Cookies will keep airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.
